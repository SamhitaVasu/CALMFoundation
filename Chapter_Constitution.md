### Article V.II: Elections/Selection Process for Leadership
All officers of a chapter, excluding the Parent Chair for middle school chapters and the Teacher Advisor, will be elected by the members of that specific C.A.L.M. chapter through a direct voting format. Candidates can only run for one non-president role along with possibly the position of Chapter President. During the annual elections, each candidate will have five minutes to convince the members that they should be in the position that they are running for. Candidates cannot use other people, videos, or audio clippings during their allotted five minutes. After each five minute slot, two minutes are provided for the audience to ask the candidate questions. After all candidates are done presenting, the voting begins. Each member has two votes for each position except president, for which they have one vote. Votes cannot be transferred among members and will be kept anonymous. In order to be elected for a position, a candidate must secure more than two thirds of the votes. If no candidate has secured enough votes to be elected for the position, the top two most voted for candidates will be put back into the ballot and a second vote will occur. During this vote, a candidate must secure more than half the votes. If a candidate wins both the position of Chapter President and another leadership position, the candidate has to choose one position to hold and the runner up will be given the other position.
